Script to parse and display/plot power consumption stats.

Parses files generated by Voltcraft's Energy Logger 4000 (google is your friend,
I bought one from Conrad for ~50EUR).

Usage:
- dump data from your EL4k, gets the files on your computer
- run something like:
  voltcraft-el4k/main.py /path/to/data/files/[A-J]*.BIN

If you have matplotlib installed, you will get a window with plotted:
- mains voltage over time
- intensity
- cosPhi
- power
- apparent power
- cost per minute
- accumulated cost
If matplotlib is not installed, you will get a bare text dump of data.

If you have configured price1 and price2, you may also provide any number of
--price1 and --price2 arguments followed by a time, and price computation will
use the right price for the right time.
Example, where price1 is active from 6:25 to 21:25:
  main.py --price1 06:25 --price2 21:25 6/*
You can provide any number of transition from price1 to price2 (and vice-
versa).
